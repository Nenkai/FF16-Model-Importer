# FF16-Model-Importer
A tool to export and import FF16 .mdl file binaries as .gltf 

## Requirements
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 9.0.9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0)

## Supports
- MDL exporting and replacing
- MTL exporting and replacing
- PZD exporting and replacing
- ANMB replacing

## Usage

In a command line window

Commands:
- Export from MDL to GLTF: `MdlConverter.exe body.mdl c1002.pac` (Extracts contents to a folder called `body` with all LOD models as .gltf. The .pac file from the character `pack` folder is required to export skeleton data)
- Import from GLTF to MDL: `MdlConverter.exe body` (Imports mdl contents back from `body` folder. Requires putting a copy of a "base" MDL file in the same directory as `body` folder. Requires all LODs in the `body` folder to be named `body_LODx` with `x` as a number)
- Export from MTL to JSON: `MdlConverter.exe material.mtl` 
- Import from JSON to MTL: `MdlConverter.exe material.mtl.json` (Currently this will overwrite old MTL file, recommended to put working JSON in another directory)
- Export from PZD to XML: `MdlConverter.exe text.pzd`
- Import from XML to PZD: `MdlConverter.exe text.pzd.xml` (Currently this will overwrite old PZD file, recommended to put working XML in another directory)
- Import from GLTF to ANMB: `MdlConverter.exe animation.glb body_base.skl` (Imports an animation, converting it from GLB/GLTF to Havok format. Requires the original skeleton file of the animation's target as a parameter)

To properly import to MDL, your GLTF model must point to only materials that are used by the "base" MDL file. You can look up the materials using a hex editor. 
Example: One of the materials that Clive's `chara/c1001/model/body/b0001/body.mdl` model uses is named `m_c1001b0001_body_a.mtl`. To assign that file to your mesh, create a material named `m_body_a` and make sure to include materials when generating your GLTF file.

To properly import to ANMB, it is recommended to use Quaternion-based rotations in your animations.
